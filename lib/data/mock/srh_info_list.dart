Communication is really important for sex and relationships. Talking to your partner during sex is how you can let them know what you do and don’t like. ‘Consent’ is when both partners agree to a specific sexual activity. Whether you’re holding hands, kissing or having sex, both partners need to agree to it and want to do it. Some people worry that asking for consent will be awkward or embarrassing, but it’s important to do. Your partner will appreciate that you respect their boundaries and care how they feel. Consent sounds simple, but here are some important things to understand:
Consent must be given freely and enthusiastically. If someone feels pressured, scared or unable to say ‘no’, it doesn’t count as consent. If you’re unsure how enthusiastic someone is, ask. Say something like ‘Are you sure?’, and reassure them that you will stop if they say no. Consent is an ongoing process. It’s always ok to change your mind, even after you’ve started having sex. You should also get your partner’s consent if you change activity, for example moving from oral to vaginal sex. Your partner will have things that they do and don’t like doing. You need to keep communicating to know that they’re still feeling good. Be aware that there are other ways to say no. Saying ‘I’m not sure’, staying silent, or using certain body language can all mean someone doesn’t want sex.
Look for these signs and check your partner is ok and wants to continue. If they don’t, you must stop.
Even if you are married or in a relationship you still need to get consent.
You always have the right to say no to sex, whatever the circumstances.
Be aware that sometimes a person cannot give consent, for example if they’re too young or drunk

Each relationship is different, but a healthy relationship should make you feel strong and supported. If your partner stops you from doing things or makes you feel less safe, it’s often a sign that your relationship is unhealthy. In a healthy relationship both partners have equal power. This means that they both have equal say when making decisions. You should be able to talk to your partner, and know that they’re interested in what you say. In healthy relationships, partners work together to resolve conflict. They listen, understand and compromise.
Learning to resolve conflict takes practice, but your disagreements should never make you feel unsafe. Good relationships involve give and take, it shouldn’t always be the same person who gets their way. Both partners should be independent, even when in a relationship. You should be able to see family, friends and do things by yourself without checking with your partner or feeling guilty. Your access to money, food and other things shouldn’t be controlled by your partner. They shouldn’t be able to take away basic things you need. Unhealthy behaviours in a relationship can develop slowly and be hard to spot at first. Notice how your relationship has changed over time, and ask if it still makes you feel happy, strong and supported. If you feel unsafe or unhappy don’t keep it a secret, a first step is to talk to someone you trust. You decide whether you want to try to solve the problems or walk away. If you want to leave your relationship, but feel afraid, get help. There are people who can help keep you safe, whether it’s someone you know, a healthcare provider, a teacher or the police. You can also look for organizations that specifically work with partner violence. These people are trained to help you out of bad situations.

How does contraception work?
Contraception works by stopping a sperm from meeting an egg, and a pregnancy from starting. Some methods, such as condoms and diaphragms, stop pregnancy by creating a barrier between the man’s sperm and the woman’s egg. Hormonal contraception interrupts a woman’s normal fertility cycle, preventing her from getting pregnant. Here are 4 common types of contraception. Each has some strengths and weaknesses
1. Condoms: Condoms are good because they’re the only contraception that prevents HIV and STIs as well. But, for condoms to be effective you have to use them correctly every time you have sex. If you forget to put it on, or put it on incorrectly, you won’t be protected.
2. The contraceptive pill: The contraceptive pill is very effective, but it relies on you remembering to take it everyday.
3. The implant: The implant will prevent pregnancy for 3 years, so you don’t need to remember it. But you must remove or replace the implant after the three years is over.
4. Injections: Contraception injections last for 8-13 weeks, so you don’t have to remember it. For some women, it can take a year for their fertility to return to normal after having injections. So, if you want a baby soon, this might not be right for you.

Syphilis is passed on through unprotected sex. You can avoid getting syphilis by using a condom, but the condom must cover the affected area.

Looking after your mental health is just as important as looking after your physical health. Good mental health allows you to feel good about yourself, have supportive relationships, take part in daily life and deal with ups and downs. Everyone has times when they feel low, anxious or overwhelmed, but it’s important to notice when it becomes too much. If these feelings continue for a long time, are severe, or affect your everyday life, it’s often a sign of a mental health condition and means that you need help. Mental health conditions can be triggered by an event such as the death of a loved one or a relationship break up, or they can come on their own. Some common mental health conditions include depression, anxiety or personality disorders. Mental distress and mental health conditions are nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, they‘re very common. Be aware if you have negative feelings for more than two weeks. These feelings include:
1. Being depressed, hopeless, ashamed or guilty a lot of the time
2. Feeling constantly tired
3. Overeating, or loss of appetite
4. Finding it hard to concentrate or sit still
5. Imagining death as a relief or having thoughts of ending your life.
People living with HIV may also find it hard to take their HIV treatment correctly, miss appointments and struggle to keep a healthy lifestyle. It may feel overwhelming, but knowing that something is wrong means you can get help and tell other people how you’re feeling. Family and friends are a good place to start, they already know you and can help you to feel less alone. You shouldn’t feel embarrassed or worried about upsetting them, they’ll want to know what’s wrong so that they can help. You might choose to discuss your feelings with a healthcare professional. They’ll be able to recognise what’s wrong and can suggest treatment. In some cases treatment will include medications such as antidepressant drugs or else talking therapies, such as counseling. If you’re living with HIV it’s important your healthcare professional knows how you’re feeling, so they can know how it could affect your overall health. Your doctor may suggest switching your antiretroviral treatment if they think it’s having an effect on your mental health. You might prefer to talk about your feelings with someone in a support group – a healthcare professional can help you find one. Getting enough exercise, sleep and nutrition is important for a healthy mind. Do things that relax and interest you. Even small activities such as going for a walk can help to lift your mood and energy levels. The most important thing is not be too hard on yourself, and keep talking to other people.

    description: """
Cervical cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer for women. The cervix is the opening of a woman’s uterus (womb), at the top of her vagina. Cervical cancer is when abnormal cells on the cervix start to grow uncontrollably. These cells can spread to other parts of the body, where they become more dangerous. Almost all cases of cervical cancer are caused by HPV, which stands for Human Papilloma Virus. HPV is an STI that’s passed on through skin to skin genital contact. HPV is very common. Most strains of the virus don’t cause harm and don't have any symptoms. However, some types of HPV can cause cancer – including cervical, anal, vaginal, throat and penis cancers. The HPV vaccine protects you from the types of HPV that cause cancer. The vaccine provides nearly 100% protection from cervical cancer. For it to work, it's best to have the HPV vaccine before having sex for the first time. This is why it’s normally offered to older children and teenagers between the ages of 9-14. As well as the HPV vaccine, many countries offer cervical screening. Cervical screening lets doctors identify any abnormal cells, before they turn into cancer. Cervical screening can save lives, so if it’s available near you, accepting cervical screening is an important way to protect your health.

What happens at cervical screening?
A healthcare professional will take a sample of cells from your cervix to test for HPV and for any abnormalities. To do this they use an instrument called a speculum. A plastic tube, that’s inserted into your vagina. The speculum allows a healthcare professional to look at your cervix and collect a sample of cells from your cervix, with small soft brush. You might feel a little discomfort but it shouldn’t be painful or embarrassing. Remember the professionals do it all the time. Your sample will be sent to a laboratory for testing and you’ll be contacted once your results are back. If there’s any signs of abnormalities, you will be invited for further testing. The healthcare professional will explain what happens next. Abnormalities won’t normally be anything to worry about. Cervical screening means you can catch any abnormal cells before cancer starts.

Others are illegal, such as cannabis, opium, heroin, cocaine and other stimulant drugs (drugs that make you very alert). Different drugs have different risks.

How do I know if my use of drugs is harmful or risky?
Drugs can also make people take risks that they wouldn't normally. If you're putting yourself in danger then your use of substances is harmful. If drugs make it hard for you to do everyday things, such as keep up good relationships, go to school or work, or manage your money, they may be harming you. If you’re finding it difficult to manage your moods, your drug use may be affecting your mental or physical health.
Regular use of psychoactives can lead to you becoming dependent on them. This means you have a strong desire to take the drug, may find it difficult to control your use of the drug, and continue to use it even if it’s harmful. You may also start thinking that taking the drug is more important than other things in your life. Over time, you might need more of the drug to feel the same effects.

Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) can reduce a man’s risk of getting HIV. VMMC removes the foreskin from a man’s penis. The foreskin is the skin that covers the end of the penis. The inside of the foreskin is moist, soft and delicate, meaning HIV can more easily enter the body. Circumcision hardens the area around the top of the penis, meaning it’s harder for HIV to enter the body. VMMC can also reduce your risk of getting other STIs such as syphilis and chlamydia. Be aware, it’s still possible for a man to get HIV if he has been circumcised but it’s less likely. VMMC is always carried out by a trained medical professional. If you have HIV, circumcision can reduce the chance of you getting other STIs, but it won’t make you less likely to pass HIV on. Before the procedure you will get an injection to numb the penis, so you don’t feel any pain. After your circumcision you should rest a little while (normally about 30 minutes). The medical staff will put a bandage on your penis that you should wear for a number of days. It’s important to keep the wound clean – don’t swim, ride a bike or do too much exercise.

There are two types of condoms. 
1. External condoms (or male condoms) which go over a penis or sex toy.

Carefully take the condom out of the packet using your fingers. Don’t use your teeth or scissors as these can damage condoms. Pinch the air out of the top of the condom. Make sure that the condom is not inside out - the rim should be on the outside so the condom rolls easily down the penis. Roll the condom down to the base of the penis. Keep the condom on until you finish having sex. When you finish, hold the condom down to the base of your penis while you withdraw. Wrap the condom in a tissue and put it in the bin.
2. Internal condoms (or female condoms) which go inside the vagina or anus.
Don’t start having sex until you have put the condom in. Check to make sure that the condom hasn’t passed its expiry date. Carefully take the condom out of the packet using your fingers. Don’t use your teeth or scissors as these can damage the condom inside. Squeeze the sides of the inner ring (by the closed end of the condom). Get into position to insert the condom – maybe lying down or squatting. Push the condom inside your vagina or anus. The outer ring should remain outside with the rest as far in as possible.
